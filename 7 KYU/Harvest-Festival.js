// The stem is represented by hyphens -, and the flowers are represented by symbols.A plant always starts with the stem, and always ends with flowers.

// Four parameters will be given.The four parameters are:

// seed(string) - determines the type of flowers generated by the plant.
//     water(integer) - each unit of water extends the portion of stem between the flowers.It also gives how many times the stems + flower clusters should be repeated
// fert(integer) - each unit of fertilizer increases the amount of flowers, grouped in clusters
// temp(integer) - if the temperature given is in the range of 20°C and 30°C, the plant grows normally, otherwise, all the flowers die except for one flower at the end of the stem.

// Given the above parameters, your task is to return a string representing the plant.

function plant(seed, water, fert, temp) {
    return 20 <= temp && temp <= 30 ? ("-".repeat(water) + seed.repeat(fert)).repeat(water) : "-".repeat(water * water) + seed
}
